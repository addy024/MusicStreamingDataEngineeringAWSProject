# Music Streams Data Engineering Project ðŸŽµðŸš€
This project focuses on building a scalable data pipeline for processing and analyzing music streaming data using AWS services. The goal is to efficiently ingest, transform, and store streaming data, enabling insightful analytics and reporting.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Tools
* AWS Glue â€“ ETL processing and data transformation
* Amazon Redshift â€“ Data warehousing for scalable analytics
* Amazon S3 â€“ Storage for raw and processed data
* MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow) â€“ Orchestration of data pipelines

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow
* Data Ingestion â€“ Music streaming data is collected and stored in S3.
* ETL Processing â€“ AWS Glue transforms raw data into structured formats.
* Data Loading â€“ Processed data is stored in Redshift for querying.
* Pipeline Orchestration â€“ MWAA (Airflow) schedules and monitors workflows.
* Data Analytics & Reporting â€“ Run SQL queries on Redshift for insights.
